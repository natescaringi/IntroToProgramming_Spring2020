# What IS Code? by Paul Ford

## Outline Assignment - February 2, 2020

The author opens with a hilariously long scenario that places you at the VP position at a large company.
Turns out your website is garbage and theres some person in a **taupe** blazer who wants to redo your website

  They show up saying that your website is:

    1. Garbage
    2. Spaghetti
    3. Garbage
    4. Mobile garbage
    5. Killing sales

  And they need the following to fix it:

    1. Money
    2. Support for his team
    3. New hires
    4. External resources

  And you don't want to because you're:

    1. More frugal than Mr. Krabs


# Why are you in this position?

## Because you don't know what code is

### So let's find out

There are an estimated 11 million professional software developers. *at the time of writing*
And apparently there are an additional 7 million that are hobbyists. *maybe more*

There are people that code for **EVERYTHING**

Including:

  1. Your TV
  2. Your Phone
  3. Your stupid Smart Watch
  4. More things than you will ever realize

>A computer is a clock with benefits. They all work the same, doing second-grade math, one step at a time: Tick, take a number and put it in box one. Tick, take another number, put it in box two. Tick, operate (an operation might be addition or subtraction) on those two numbers and put the resulting number in box one. Tick, check if the result is zero, and if it is, go to some other box and follow a new set of instructions.

_This is also how my brain works_

What differentiates a computer from a 7 year old however, is that a computer can do math problems a million billion times per second. Which allows it to do an absolutely insane amount of things that a 7 year old could do if given enough time, and was 7 for literally thousands of years.

### How does code become software?
#### Where's the line...

In the _old days_ "code" meant putting holes in punch cards for massive computers to read. It would sort through the cards and then update little bits of memory that were applicable.

Code can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from super low-level jibberish that 4 people can understand to doing simple commands in Excel or Scratch.


## Algorithms

> “Algorithm” is a word writers invoke to sound smart about technology. Journalists tend to talk about “Facebook’s algorithm” or a “Google algorithm,” which is usually inaccurate. They mean “software.”

Fundamentally, algorithms solve problems.
  For instance, Dijkstra's algorithm is one that finds the shortest path in a graph.

  *and no, not a bar graph*

Going one level higher than this, programming languages are effectively systems for encoding, naming, and organizing algorithms for reuse and application.

  _An algorithm management system_

## So why are programmers so intense about languages?
