## Outline Assignment - February 2, 2020

The author opens with a hilariously long scenario that places you at the VP position at a large company.
Turns out your website is garbage and theres some person in a **taupe** blazer who wants to redo your website

  They show up saying that your website is:
    1. Garbage
    2. Spaghetti
    3. Garbage
    4. Mobile garbage
    5. Killing sales

  And they need the following to fix it:
    1. Money
    2. Support for his team
    3. New hires
    4. External resources

  And you don't want to because you're:
    1. More frugal than Mr. Krabs
