# Notes Week 2

## Tools of the trade

1. Functions: actions/verbs
2. Bindings: grasp information (_variable in a function_)
3. Conditions: send you down different paths, if... then...
4. Boolean: true or false
5. Loops: leads to cycles
6. Syntax: organization of information

### Example: Pseudocode

> 0 pick up phone book
1 open to middle of phone book
2 look at names
3 if Smith is among names
4   call Mike
5 else if Smith is earlier in book
6   open to middle of left half of book
7   go back to step 2
8 else if Smith is later in book
9   open to middle of right half of book
10  go back to step 2
11 else
12  quit

The syntax is structured so that you would go down the list and follow through with the if then statements.

The tabs represent the if then statements
