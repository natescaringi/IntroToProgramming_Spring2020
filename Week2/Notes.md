# Notes Week 2

## Tools of the trade

1. Functions: actions/verbs
2. Bindings: grasp information (_variable in a function_)
3. Conditions: send you down different paths, if... then...
4. Boolean: true or false
5. Loops: leads to cycles
6. Syntax: organization of information

### Example: Pseudocode

> 0. pick up phone book
>1. open to middle of phone book
>2. look at names
>3. if Smith is among names
>4.   call Mike
>5. else if Smith is earlier in book
>6.   open to middle of left half of book
>7.   go back to step 2
>8. else if Smith is later in book
>9.   open to middle of right half of book
>10.  go back to step 2
>11. else
>12.  quit

The syntax is structured so that you would go down the list and follow through with the if then statements.

The tabs represent the if then statements

### Pseudocode Exercise

0. Look at clock
1. If minute hand is on a written digit
2.    jump up and down 3 times
3. If minute hand is not on a written digit
4.    sit down on the ground

*You need to be specific as possible with computer code, computers are STUPID and will do anything LITERALLY. You gotta include stop functions otherwise it'll never stop*
