*Notes Week 4*

__abstraction__ = information that the machine/person can take for granted when executing instructions

__a flow chart__

  - __human readable__ -> source code -> compiler -> binary code -> __machine readable__

**compiling**

- Compiling source code into machine code is broken into a series of smaller steps

  those being:
    1. preprocessing
    2. compiling
    3. assembling
    4. linking

**Common C Libraries**
  - *stdio.h*
  - ctype.h
  - math.h - this one does math
  - stdbool.h - boolean searches
  - string.h

Some types of data types and conversions:
  - integer %d (whole number)
  - character %c (abcdefg...)
  - floating-point %f (decimal)
  - string (sequence of characters - NOT arrays) %s
