_Assignment 4 - Nate Scaringi_

For this assignment I went to the class tutor because I wasn't really grasping the syntax of how C was actually working. After he explained to me basically how the computer executed the code it made it a lot easier for me to understand which parts of the for loops affected which parts of the print. The main problem I faced was really just a lack of knowledge of how the code was actually working, but once I went to the tutor and he helped me through it, those problems started to clear up. Thinking about the code like a computer is definitely something that I am going to have to continually work on because they're literally so dumb, but now I feel like I have a marginally better understanding of where to start. In this assignment, we basically had to figure out a way for our C file to generate a pyramid shape when executed. So this implies that the integers in the code wouldn't just be static whole numbers. It took me a bit to grapple how the code was running but once I did, it really was just a simple math problem to figure out how to increment the "X value" by 1. I ended up setting one of the conditions for "J" to be "j < (i+1)" which used the integer value from the first for loop, which generated the "Y axis", and added one to it, which increased the number of # added to "X axis" every time the code executed. I still definitely don't have the strongest grasp on this stuff yet but I'm slowly catching up!
